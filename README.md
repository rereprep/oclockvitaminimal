This is a minimalist version of Oclock Vita plugin which belongs to frangarcj (https://github.com/frangarcj/oclockvita). I removed the menu code
and button hooks, it now auto-activates at start and set the CPU/GPU to max. All credits to frangarcj, i love his work, i haven't added a single
line of code to his release, i only erased some stuff. This was meant for my private use but since some people showed interest, i decided to post
it.

# Oclock Vita Minimal
taiHEN plugin for overclocking your PSVita

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put "oclockvitaminimal.suprx" in 'tai' folder in the root of your Vita.

Change config.txt in that directory to load plugin for title of your choice by adding new lines like below:

```text
# titleid for your game (this one is for Root//Letter for example)
*PCSB01019
ux0:tai/oclockvitaminimal.suprx
```

After that just run the game. It will set the CPU/GPU to max when the game is started.
